      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> We collect your answers to a short questionnaire and your ratings of audio clips to support research on misophonia. This may be considered medical data, and you consent to us processing it. We momentarily use your IP address, which can identify you, to deliver the web pages but it is not saved in our systems. After this, we cannot connect your responses with your identity. We publish this anonymized data openly.</p>

      <h2>Who we are</h2>
      <p>
        Lukas Frimer Tholander (lukt at itu.dk) and Tonio Ermakoff (toner at itu.dk)
      </p>
      <p>
        IT University of Copenhagen<br>

      </p>

      <h2>What we collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Study responses:</strong> age group, gender, country; answers to a short misophonia questionnaire (DMQ items, considered health-related data); which sound categories trigger you; your discomfort ratings and sound identifications; timestamps; simple device/headphone check results.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical data:</strong> basic connection information needed to show the pages. We only process your IP address or other direct identifiers momentarily.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why we collect it</h2>
      <p>To conduct the study, analyze results, and create a <strong>anonymized, open research dataset</strong> that others can use to develop and evaluate misophonia-targeted noise-cancelling headphones.</p>

      <h2>Our legal basis</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Your consent</strong> to take part and for us to process your personal data (GDPR Art. 6(1)(a)).</li>
        <li><strong>Your explicit consent</strong> to process health-related data in the questionnaire (GDPR Art. 9(2)(a)).</li>
        <li>We apply GDPR <strong>research safeguards</strong> when keeping anonymized data for scientific purposes (GDPR Art. 89).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How long we keep data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>IP address:</strong> momentarily.</li>
        <li><strong>Anonymized research data:</strong> published and kept forever.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Who can see your data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Our research team</strong> for analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Service providers</strong> that host the survey or computing infrastructure (under contract and confidentiality). Contact us for more information.</li>
        <li><strong>Public release:</strong> we may publish a <em>anonymized</em> dataset (no direct identifiers).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>International transfers</h2>
      <p>If any service providers are outside the EU/EEA, we use approved safeguards (for example, the EU Standard Contractual Clauses). Contact us to learn more and obtain a copy of the relevant safeguards.</p>

      <h2>Your choices and rights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Voluntary participation:</strong> you can skip participation and end the study at any time.</li>
        <li><strong>Withdraw consent:</strong> you may withdraw your consent at any time (this does not affect processing already carried out). You do this by not participating further in the study.</li>
        <li><strong>Your rights:</strong> access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, and objection. Because we avoid storing direct identifiers and anonymize early, we may not be able to locate your individual record later; if so, we will explain why.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To use your rights or ask questions, contact us using the information provided in the top of this document. We will respond without undue delay and usually within one month.</p>

      <h2>Children</h2>
      <p>This study is for adults (18+) only. We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

You also have the right to complain to the Danish Data Protection Agency (Datatilsynet): Carl Jacobsens Vej 35, 2500 Valby, Denmark; +45 33 19 32 00; <a href="mailto:dt@datatilsynet.dk">dt@datatilsynet.dk</a>; <a href="https://www.datatilsynet.dk/english/file-a-complaint" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to file a complaint</a>.</p>
